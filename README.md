# customer-segmentation
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their behavioral and numerical features. The goal is to identify meaningful customer groups that can help in decision-making such as targeted marketing, personalization, and business strategy.

## **Project Workflow:**

**Data Loading & Cleaning**

*Handled missing values

*Removed outliers using statistical techniques

*Normalized numerical features for clustering


## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Distribution analysis of numerical features

* Correlation checks

* Visualizations to understand data patterns


## **Optimal Number of Clusters**

* Used Elbow Method

* Used Silhouette Score

* Chosen optimal k = 2


## **Model Training**

* Applied KMeans (sklearn)

* Evaluated model performance

* Added cluster labels to the dataset

* Interpreted cluster characteristics


## **Technologies Used**

* Python

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib / Seaborn

* scikit-learn


**Project Files**

* rv4.ipynb
* cleaned_data.csv
* clustered_output.csv


## **Key Insights**

* Optimal clusters: 2

* Clear separation of customers based on spending and other numerical behaviors

* Useful for targeted marketing and personalization
